I want to thank [Duncaen](https://github.com/Duncaen), [Stefano Ragni](https://github.com/st3r4g) and [heliocat](https://www.reddit.com/user/cathexis08/) for posting their own s6 setups and particularly Duncaen for making some really good s6-rc services source files.

Special thank you to [Laurent Bercot](https://skarnet.org/), a.k.a. ska or skarnet or "the s6 guy," for creating and continuing development on the whole s6 stack and beyond.

Links of interest, but very outdated.
